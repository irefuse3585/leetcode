# LeetCode #3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## ðŸ“– Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  
- **Input:** a string `s` (may be empty, can contain any characters).  
- **Output:** an integer â€” the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

## ðŸš€ Solution (O(n))

1. Initialize:  
   - `last_pos = {}` â€” a dictionary to store the last index of each character.  
   - `left = 0` â€” the left boundary of the sliding window.  
   - `max_len = 0` â€” the maximum length found so far.

2. Iterate through the string in one pass:  
   ```python
   for right, ch in enumerate(s):
       if ch in last_pos and last_pos[ch] >= left:
           # if the character repeats within current window,
           # move the left boundary right after its previous occurrence
           left = last_pos[ch] + 1
       # update the last occurrence of the character
       last_pos[ch] = right
       # update the maximum length
       max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
   ```

3. Return `max_len`.

## ðŸ”¢ Example

```
s = "pwwkew"
# result â†’ 3  # substring "wke"
```

## ðŸ“Š Complexity

- **Time:** O(n) â€” each character is processed once, dictionary lookups are O(1).  
- **Space:** O(min(n, Î£)) â€” we store last positions for characters (Î£ = size of the character set).
